# The prime factor decomposition

A prime is an integer that has exactly 2 divisors: 1 and itself.
e.g.
2 is a prime because its divisors are only 1 and 2
3 is a prime because its divisors are only 1 and 3
4 is not a prime because its divisors are 1, 2, 4
5 is a prime because its divisors are only 1 and 5
6 is not a prime because its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6
7 is a prime because its divisors are only 1 and 7
8 is not a prime because its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8
9 is not a prime because its divisors are 1, 3, 9

Every number can be decomposed into primes which means that every number can be written as the product of prime numbers.
e.g.
2 = 2
3 = 3
4 = 2 * 2
5 = 5
6 = 2 * 3
8 = 2 * 2 * 2
9 = 3 * 3
10 = 2 * 5
12 = 2 * 2 * 3
15 = 3 * 5

The goal of this project is to decompose any number into a list of its prime factors.
We used TDD in order to develop the main algorithm.
We have been inspired by the kata presented by Robert C. Martin aka uncle bob.
